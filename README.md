I generally find it fun to make my own structures and functions that fit my specific needs rather than find a crate that solves my problems in ways that actually make sense. This crate is meant to be my own library of macros, functions, and structs that ive found useful across multiple projects.

Feel free to use it, but i advise you dont, as most of the things here are not super well made, feature-complete, or polished for other users. Hopefully ill end up publishing more actually good tools, as this project will likely be the beta-breeding ground of those.

This will also likely be VERY unstable, as i dont expect anyone else to use this and wont account for much outside of my own projects, hence this being a dev-dep on githup instead of crates.io.

if you want need examples check out the test file for some simple ones.

Feel free to copy some of my code if you find it useful!
